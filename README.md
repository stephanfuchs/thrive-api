# Getting started
1. `./scripts/init_project.sh` to get the basic setup running
2. `./scripts/start_rails.sh` should always run and will provide a server on port 8086
3. If you want to run rails commands in the docker container run `./scripts/rails.sh your-command`


# Other scripts
- `./scripts/toggle_cache.sh` will allow you to toggle caching. By default rails will not cache.
